                    <h2>The Journey</h2>
                    <p class="bio-intro">Three-time award-winning composer (National Prize 2002, Documentary Prize 2019, London Film Festival 2015) and strategic concept developer. Founder of a systematic innovation pipeline generating humanity-first technology solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>My journey began at age six, conducting my first-grade class with a stick at a school event. What started as childhood instinct evolved into a lifelong commitment to music, innovation, and the belief that technology should amplify human creativity, not replace it.</p>
                    
                    <p>After being recognized as the "Most Talented Student Ever" at Peiraikos Syndesmos Conservatory in 1995 following a complete improvised concert, I was accepted to London's prestigious Royal College of Music in 1999. But instead of following the traditional academic path, I chose the streets of London—learning from street musicians who taught me the raw, authentic language of music that no institution could provide.</p>
                    
                    <p>That decision shaped everything that followed: a career built on authenticity, a commitment to humanitarian storytelling through documentary scores, and an approach to innovation that puts human flourishing at the center.</p>

                    <p>Music transcends borders, politics, and language barriers. It's the universal tongue that connects humanity at its deepest level.
