                    <h3>"Returning Home"</h3>
                    <p class="work-meta">2020 • Orchestral Composition</p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        Dedicated to Ukrainians who left their homeland seeking a better life, this orchestral work combines modern instruments with the main melodic theme from piano. Completed in 2020 before the tragic events of 2022, the composition gained prophetic resonance with the Russian invasion—transforming from a piece about migration and hope into a haunting meditation on displacement and longing for return.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        The orchestration blends traditional orchestral elements with contemporary production techniques, creating a soundscape that bridges past and present, homeland and diaspora, loss and hope.

                    <p class="work-meta">2019 • Documentary Score</p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        Winner of Best Long Length Documentary at the 13th Greek Documentary Festival in Chalkida (2019). Produced by the Hellenic Foundation for Historical Studies (IDISME) with historical consultancy by Irini Sarioglou.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        This score demonstrates the power of music to elevate historical narrative, weaving emotional depth through documentary storytelling. The composition serves not just as background but as a narrative voice—amplifying the film's exploration of historical themes through orchestral language.

                    <p class="work-meta">2002 • Piano Composition</p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        First Prize winner at Greece's National Music Competition (X.O.N.), this piano composition marked a defining moment in establishing compositional credentials. The piece explores the paradox inherent in its title—the impossibility of true silence in music, the spaces between notes that give sound its meaning, and the tension between expression and restraint.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        Written during a period of intense creative exploration, "Absolute Silence" represents the culmination of years studying both formal technique and street music's raw authenticity. The work demonstrates that technical mastery and emotional honesty need not be opposing forces.

                    <p class="work-description">
                        Winner of Special Jury Award for Human Rights and Environment at the London Greek Film Festival (Odysseus Awards, 2015). Produced by the Hellenic Foundation for Historical Studies (IDISME), this documentary score demonstrates commitment to humanitarian storytelling through music.
                    </p>
                    <p class="work-description">
                        The composition weaves environmental themes with human rights narratives, using orchestral language to amplify the documentary's urgent message. This international recognition validated an approach to film scoring that prioritizes emotional truth and social consciousness over conventional documentary music tropes.
