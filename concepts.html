                        <h4>The Problem Major Platforms Can't Solve</h4>
                        <p>For years, major streaming services have wanted to offer interactive music experiences. They've been blocked by a fundamental challenge that has nothing to do with technology and everything to do with rights management.</p>
                        
                        <p>Apple integrated advanced audio features into Logic Pro but can't enable them in Apple Music. Spotify launched basic mixing features but avoided the core functionality entirely. YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Tidal—all facing the same wall.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The Insight Only a Composer Would See</h4>
                        <p>MICS solves what streaming platforms have been unable to solve: enabling truly interactive music experiences while remaining completely label-safe. The solution doesn't come from the technology side—it comes from understanding how music rights actually work.</p>
                        
                        <p>This isn't about building better technology. It's about seeing the problem from a different angle—one that becomes obvious when you've spent decades creating music, understanding licensing, and working within rights frameworks.</p>

                        <h4>Market Timing</h4>
                        <p>We're in the "Death to Spotify" moment. Platforms desperately need differentiation. MICS provides exactly what they've been trying to build for years—without the licensing nightmares that have stalled their efforts.</p>

                        <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                        <p>Every major streaming platform has explored this space. Every one has hit the same wall. MICS represents a solution they need but haven't been able to implement—developed by someone who understands both the music and the business.</p>

                    <p>Identify spaces where technology has created friction, undermined human values, or failed to serve genuine needs. Look for problems others miss because they're too close to the technology.</p>
